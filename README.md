# Spatial Analysis of DMD mice

This repository contains analysis scripts reproducing the results in the paper titled **"Spatial transcriptomics reveal markers of histopathological changes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models"**
Authors: L.G.M. Heezen, T. Abdelaal, M. van Putten, A. Aartsma-Rus, A. Mahfouz and P. Spitali

The scripts are used for processing of Visium data obtained from two wildtypes: C57BL10 and DBA/2J and two DMD mouse models: mdx and D2-mdx. Ten weeks old male mice, 10micron thick sections of quadriceps.
